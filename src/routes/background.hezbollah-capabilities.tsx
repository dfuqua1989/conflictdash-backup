    h: "What it is",
    p: "Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shia Islamist movement that operates as a hybrid organization: a political party holding seats in parliament and, at times, cabinet posts, alongside a separate and far larger military wing. That dual structure is central to why disarmament negotiations are so fraught — the political wing survives any military setback, and Lebanon's fragile sectarian power-sharing system gives it institutional leverage no purely militant group would have.",
  },
  {
    h: "Force structure",
    p: "Independent estimates (IISS, CSIS) put pre-2024 active fighting strength at roughly 20,000–25,000, with a reserve/mobilizable pool cited as high as 100,000 by some Israeli assessments — figures that are inherently uncertain given the group's secrecy. Its arsenal was long described as the largest non-state rocket/missile stockpile in the world, built around large numbers of short-range rockets supplemented by a smaller but more consequential precision-guided missile program developed with Iranian and Syrian assistance.",
  },
  {
    h: "The 2024 degradation",
    p: "The group absorbed the heaviest blow in its history in 2024: the September pager/radio device attacks disabled much of its mid-level command network in a single day, and an Israeli strike weeks later killed longtime Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah along with most of his senior command tier. Naim Qassem, previously deputy secretary-general, was named successor. CSIS and IISS assessments through 2025–26 describe the precision-missile program and top command structure as substantially degraded, even as the broader rocket stockpile and rank-and-file manpower base remain largely intact.",
  },
  {
    h: "The Iran linkage",
    p: "Hezbollah is the most capable member of what Iran calls its ‘Axis of Resistance’ and has historically received funding, training and weapons transfers via the IRGC-Quds Force, alongside its own financing streams (diaspora networks, and disputed allegations of illicit trade). Tehran's doctrine of ‘unity of the fronts’ treats Lebanon as a forward deterrent extending Iran's own reach to Israel's northern border.",
  },
  {
    h: "Why disarmament is the crux",
    p: "Post-2024 diplomatic frameworks have asked Hezbollah to accept verified disarmament as the price of a full Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. That demand asks the group to give up the one asset — its arsenal — that gives its political wing continued leverage inside Lebanon and its patron continued reach toward Israel. That structural bind, more than any single tactical dispute, is why successive rounds of talks have stalled rather than any specific term of a deal.",
