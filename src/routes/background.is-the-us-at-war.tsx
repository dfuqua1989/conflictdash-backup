    h: "The short answer",
    p: "No, and yes. No — the United States has not had a constitutionally declared war since Congress declared war on Romania in June 1942, near the end of World War II. Every US military engagement since Korea has run on a different legal basis: authorizations for the use of military force, the War Powers Resolution, or purely executive action framed as self-defense or counter-terrorism. Yes — by any plain-English definition of the word, American forces are engaged in active combat right now, most clearly in the campaign against Iran, and are conducting lethal operations in the Caribbean under a separate legal theory entirely. The formal label and the observable reality have been disconnected for eight decades, and 2026 is no exception.",
  },
  {
    h: "Why “declared war” stopped being how this works",
    p: "The US Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to declare war — but Congress hasn't exercised that specific power in over 80 years, even through Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and now Iran. In practice, presidents have relied on broader legal instruments: the 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force, the War Powers Resolution's 60-90 day window for unauthorized deployments, or simply executive authority to act in what the administration characterizes as national self-defense. Critics across the political spectrum — including UN human rights experts on other fronts, like Pakistan's campaign in Afghanistan — argue this pattern erodes the actual constitutional check the declaration requirement was designed to provide. Supporters argue the modern pace of conflict makes a congressional vote before every strike impractical. Either way, “war” and “declared war” have not meant the same thing in US practice for generations.",
  },
  {
    h: "Iran: the one that actually looks like a war",
    p: "Of everything the US is currently doing militarily, the Iran conflict is the one that fits the ordinary meaning of “war” without much argument. US and Israeli forces have struck Iranian military and nuclear infrastructure; Iran has struck back at US-linked targets across the Gulf, including Kuwait, Jordan and Bahrain; a naval blockade of the Iranian coast has been in place since April 2026; and as of early August, the US and Israel were preparing a further round of strikes on Iranian energy infrastructure, with Iran's own military command publicly warning of a “full-scale regional war.” No congressional declaration covers any of it. The operative legal basis is presidential authority to respond to what the administration frames as Iranian threats to US forces and allies in the region — a framework that has produced sustained, reciprocal combat without ever being labeled a war in the constitutional sense.",
  },
  {
    h: "The Caribbean: lethal, but a different legal category entirely",
    p: "Operation Southern Spear is not a war against a state — it's a campaign of lethal strikes against vessels the US alleges are smuggling narcotics, conducted primarily off Venezuela and through the Caribbean. Over 220 people have been killed in these strikes since September 2025, under counter-narcotics authority rather than any war-powers framework. Human rights organizations, including WOLA, have characterized the killings as extrajudicial, since strikes are conducted without the normal legal process that would apply to interdicting a criminal suspect. The Trump administration disputes that framing and maintains the strikes are a legitimate exercise of executive authority against traffickers. Whatever the legal characterization, the operation has produced far more US-inflicted deaths than most declared conflicts the US has fought since Vietnam.",
  },
  {
    h: "What doesn't count, and why the distinction matters",
    p: "Not every US military commitment is a war, even when it involves real risk and real money. Support for Ukraine — weapons, training, intelligence — doesn't put American service members in direct combat with Russian forces, which is the meaningful line between arming a partner and fighting a war yourself. Carrier deployments to the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea are deterrence, not combat — their entire purpose is to make an actual war less likely by demonstrating the cost of starting one. Collapsing all of this into a single “is America at war” yes-or-no question obscures more than it reveals. The more useful question, and the one this page is actually trying to answer, is which of America's many military commitments involve US forces taking and returning fire right now — and as of August 2026, that's Iran, unambiguously, and the Caribbean, in a narrower but still lethal sense.",
