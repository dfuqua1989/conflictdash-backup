    h: "What actually happened in 2025 — and why it was different",
    p: "The four-day war in May 2025 was the most serious India-Pakistan confrontation since the 1999 Kargil conflict, and it broke new ground in a specific way: both sides used advanced weapons systems in combat that neither had previously deployed against the other, including cruise missiles, short-range ballistic missiles and drones. Pakistan's Chinese-supplied HQ-9B air-defense system failed to intercept Indian BrahMos missiles, a real-world test of Chinese military technology against a serious opponent that defense analysts on both sides are still studying. It ended not because either side achieved a decisive result, but because international pressure forced a ceasefire before the fighting could escalate further.",
  },
  {
    h: "Ceasefire without reconciliation",
    p: "That's the phrase analysts consistently use to describe the year since, and it's precise: the ceasefire has held completely — no resumption of cross-border fire, no further strikes — while literally nothing about the underlying dispute has moved. Both governments have used the anniversary to reinforce domestic narratives of victory rather than pursue any dialogue. Pakistan's army chief Asim Munir was elevated to field marshal after the war and has since positioned himself publicly as a regional peacemaker, even while Pakistan deepens a defense relationship with China — including pursuit of the longer-range HQ-19 missile-defense system — in ways that visibly worry New Delhi.",
  },
  {
    h: "The dispute the war never touched",
    p: "The war started over a specific attack, but the conflict underneath it is the same one that's defined India-Pakistan relations since Partition in 1947: the status of Kashmir. Nothing in the 2025 war or its aftermath changed that dispute in any way. If anything, the war demonstrated that both sides are willing to strike further and use more advanced weapons than in any prior post-nuclearization confrontation, while a full-scale war remains something neither side wants — mutual nuclear deterrence is the thing actually keeping the peace, not any diplomatic progress.",
  },
  {
    h: "What would actually trigger a second round",
    p: "Analysts point to the same pattern that triggered 2025: a mass-casualty militant attack inside India that New Delhi attributes to Pakistan-based groups, followed by Indian cross-border strikes. That's the mechanism that has repeated multiple times since 2016 — Uri, Pulwama, now Pahalgam — each one larger than the last. The specific risk going forward is less about deliberate escalation from either government and more about whether militant groups operating from Pakistani soil, over which Islamabad's control is itself contested, carry out another attack severe enough to force an Indian response.",
  },
  {
    h: "The China factor now shaping the calculus",
    p: "The most significant post-war shift isn't military — it's the visible deepening of the Pakistan-China defense relationship, which India's strategic establishment now treats as a standing complication rather than a one-off. Pakistan deployed Chinese weapons in real combat for the first time in 2025, and analysts on both sides are still assessing what that test revealed about Chinese military technology. For India, any future crisis now has to be weighed against China's principal strategic rival deepening ties with India's principal regional rival — a dynamic that didn't exist in the same way before 2025.",
  },
  {
    h: "The case for cautious optimism",
    p: "Despite the tension, some analysts argue a durable thaw isn't as far-fetched as it looks. Bilateral relations have eased after previous periods of conflict, often followed by a revival of trade and cultural ties, and there's no shortage of historical precedent for that pattern repeating. The obstacle isn't necessarily appetite for de-escalation — it's the ease with which a single attack can reset the relationship back to crisis footing, which is exactly what happened in April 2025 and has happened multiple times before that.",
