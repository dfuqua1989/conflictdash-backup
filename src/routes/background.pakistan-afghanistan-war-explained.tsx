    h: "This isn't a border dispute — it's about one militant group",
    p: "Pakistan and Afghanistan share the Durand Line, a colonial-era border that Kabul has never formally recognized, and cross-border tension is nothing new. But the current war has a much narrower cause: Pakistan wants the Afghan Taliban government to shut down the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that uses Afghan soil to plan and launch attacks inside Pakistan. Everything else — the airstrikes, the declared “open war,” the collapsed truces — flows from Pakistan's demand and the Taliban's refusal to fully meet it.",
  },
  {
    h: "Brothers in arms, not just neighbors",
    p: "The TTP and the Afghan Taliban are separate organizations, but they share ideology, ethnic composition and a common history — the TTP essentially modeled itself on the Afghan Taliban and fought alongside it for years before the Afghan Taliban retook power in 2021. Afghan Taliban leaders reportedly view TTP fighters as “brothers in blood and arms” and are reluctant to move against them, partly out of loyalty and partly out of calculation: if the Taliban's own rule in Afghanistan ever collapsed, TTP-controlled areas inside Pakistan could serve as a fallback sanctuary, the same way Afghanistan itself served the Taliban during the US occupation years.",
  },
  {
    h: "From strikes to a declared war",
    p: "Pakistan's frustration built through 2025 as TTP attacks inside Pakistan continued despite repeated diplomatic pressure on Kabul. The October 2025 strike on a TTP leader inside Kabul — the first on the Afghan capital itself — marked an escalation in method, not just intent. A negotiated truce followed but didn't hold. When Pakistan struck TTP camps again in February 2026 and the Taliban retaliated across the border, Pakistan's defense minister made the conflict official, declaring “open war” and launching a named military campaign rather than continuing a pattern of deniable cross-border strikes.",
  },
  {
    h: "The hospital strike and the legal fight over who's right",
    p: "The war's most consequential single event was a March 16, 2026 Pakistani strike on a drug-rehabilitation facility in Kabul that Afghan officials say killed more than 400 people. Pakistan disputed the account. Independent of that specific dispute, UN human rights experts have said Pakistan's broader campaign violates the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force, rejecting Islamabad's self-defense justification on the grounds that the Taliban government itself had not directly attacked Pakistan — only the TTP had, and Pakistan has not published evidence tying TTP attacks directly to Taliban command and control.",
  },
  {
    h: "Why China's truces keep collapsing",
    p: "China has repeatedly brokered pauses in the fighting, including a five-day truce around the end of Ramadan in 2026, using its investment leverage over both governments. None have held beyond a few weeks, because the truces address the fighting without resolving the underlying demand — the Taliban still hasn't committed to move against the TTP in any verifiable way. Russia has separately struck a deal with the Taliban, reportedly focused on repairing Russian-made military equipment, which worries Pakistan that Kabul is quietly building capacity for future conflicts regardless of who mediates the current one.",
  },
  {
    h: "What actually ends this",
    p: "Analysts see limited realistic paths to a lasting resolution. A genuine Taliban crackdown on the TTP risks internal fractures within the Taliban's own coalition, or could push TTP fighters toward even more extreme rivals like Islamic State-Khorasan. Pakistan, meanwhile, has shown no sign of accepting a ceasefire that doesn't include some verifiable action against TTP sanctuaries. That leaves the most likely near-term outcome as a continuation of the current pattern: periodic strikes, brief internationally brokered pauses, and a fundamental disagreement that no mediator has yet found a way to bridge.",
